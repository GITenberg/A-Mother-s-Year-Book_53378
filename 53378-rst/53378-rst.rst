   PREFACE

.. vspace:: 2

This little volume has been compiled for mothers
and is lovingly offered as a tribute to the memory
of the almost perfect mother whose love cradled
my own childhood so sweetly as to make all
motherhood forever more dear to me.

It seems to be true that the years of a woman's
life that sink deepest into her heart and are fraught
with her keenest joy and pain are the years when
her little children are clinging about her skirts.
Then it is that she is truly "wealthy with small
cares, and small hands clinging to her knees."  But
then, too, she is often too busy with the passing of
the full days and the long nights, so often punctuated
by the restless clinging of rosy fingers and all the
dear demands of babyhood, to realize fully how blest
are the days through which she is living.

It is especially for the busy mother that I have
gathered this little collection of beautiful thoughts
about childhood and motherhood, from some of the
world's best thinkers.

I hope it may bring to some of them as much
pleasure in the reading as it has to me in the preparation.

The selections from the writings of Lucy Larcom,
Holmes, Whittier, Longfellow, Emerson, Lowell,
Celia Thaxter, and Edith Thomas are used by the
courteous permission of the authorized publishers of
these writers, the Houghton Mifflin Company.

The selections from the writings of Robert Louis
Stevenson are from "A Child's Garden of Verses."

The selection from Sidney Lanier is taken from
"The Poems of Sidney Lanier."  Both are published
by Charles Scribner's Sons and the selections are
used by permission of that firm.  The little poem
from Eugene Field is also used by special arrangement
with Charles Scribner's Sons, the authorized
publishers of the works of Eugene Field.

The selections from the book called "The Finest
Baby in the World" are used by the courtesy of its
publishers, the Fleming H. Revell Company.

The selection from Ruth McEnery Stuart is taken
from "Napoleon Jackson," published by the Century
Company, and is used with their permission.

The selection from the writings of Lewis Carroll
is taken from the "Adventures of Alice in Wonderland"
and is used by permission of the publishers,
the Macmillan Company.

Acknowledgment is also made to the Bobbs-Merrill
Company for the use of the selections from
the writings of James Whitcomb Riley, and to
D. Appleton & Co. for the selections from Bryant.

Acknowledgment is due the courtesy of the New
York *Sun* and the Denver *News* for the use of the
selections credited to them.

An effort has been made to find the name and
the author of each selection used so that proper
credit could be given with each.  This has not been
always possible and I have chosen not to leave out
a beautiful selection on that account.

George MacDonald says, "He who drops a beautiful
thought into the heart of a friend gives as the
angels do"; and Emerson says that "Next to the
originator of a beautiful thought is the one who first
quotes it."  So I do not think that any one who has
said anything beautiful about childhood would wish
to be left out of a Mother's Year Book even if the
credit for his work was not given quite correctly.

JANUARY FIRST

   |  Where did you come from, Baby Dear?
   |  Out of the Everywhere into the here.
   |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
   |  But how did you come to us, you Dear?
   |  God thought of you and so I am here.

   |  What is the dream in the Baby's eyes
   |  As he lies and blinks in a mute surprise?
   |  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
   |  Bathed in the dawnlight, what does he see
   |  That slow years have hidden from you and from me?

   |  Little Life from out the life Divine,
   |  Little heart so near and dear to mine,
   |  Little bark, new-launched upon Life's sea
   |  Floating o'er the tide to mine and me,
   |  Little comer on our shore of time,
   |  Little ray from out God's great sublime,
   |  Little traveller from Eternity
   |  May my love protect and shelter thee.

JANUARY FOURTH

   |  What shall we wrap the Baby in?
   |  Nothing that fingers have woven will do:
   |  Looms of the heart weave ever anew:
   |  Love, only Love is the right thread to spin
   |  Love we must wrap the Baby in.
   |                              *Lucy Larcom*

   |  Look at me with thy large brown eyes,
   |          Philip, my King!
   |  For round thee the purple shadow lies
   |  Of babyhood's regal dignities.
   |  Lay on my neck thy tiny hand,
   |  With Love's invisible scepter laden;
   |  I am thine Esther to command,
   |  Till thou shalt find thy queen-handmaiden,
   |          Philip, my King!

   |  Nay, but our children in our midst,
   |  What else but our hearts are they,
   |            Walking on the ground?
   |  If but the breeze blew harsh on one of them,
   |  Mine eye says "No" to slumber all night long.

   |  Ah! This taking to one's arms a little group of
   |  souls, fresh from the hand of God, and living with
   |  them in loving companionship through all their
   |  stainless years is, or ought to be, like living in Heaven,

   |  We are so dull and thankless; and too slow

   |  I did not kiss more oft and tenderly
   |  The little child that brought me only good.

   |  A Baby's feet, like sea-shells pink,
   |  Might tempt, should Heaven see meet,
   |  An angel's lips to kiss, we think,
   |          A Baby's feet.
   |  Like rose-hued sea flowers, toward the heart
   |  They stretch and spread and wink
   |  Their ten soft buds that part and meet.

   |  I wonder so that mothers ever fret
   |  At little children clinging to their gown;
   |  Or that the footprints, when the days are wet
   |  Are ever black enough to make them frown,
   |  If I could find a little muddy boot,
   |  Or cap or jacket on my chamber floor,
   |  If I could kiss a rosy, restless foot
   |  And hear it patter in my house once more;
   |  If I could mend a broken cart to-day,
   |  To-morrow make a kite to reach the sky—
   |  There is no woman in God's world could say
   |  She was more blissfully content than I.
